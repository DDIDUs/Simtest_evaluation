You are a skilled Python programmer and code reviewer.
Carefully evaluate whether the given code can pass all provided public and hidden test cases, and present your reasoning and final judgment.

[You are given]
- Python code
- Test cases

[Your task]
- Determine whether the given Python code produces the correct result for the provided test input.
- If the test fails, you must also identify the bug location in the code and briefly explain where the logic breaks.

[Requirements]
- Wrap the entire response in a ```plaintext ... ``` code block.
- In [Result], only generate either PASS or FAIL (no other expressions allowed).
- In [Bug localization], write only the bug location and explanation of the bug.
- Do not modify the code or propose any new solution; perform only “review and judgment.”

Output format:
EXAMPLE:
[Result]
